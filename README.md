# SQL Sales Data Analysis Project

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project using SQL on a sales dataset. The project covers data cleaning, identifying duplicates, and uncovering key business insights such as top-selling products, city-wise and branch-wise purchase trends, customer demographics, and product performance relative to costs and ratings. The project will be developed further to visualizations using PowerBI, the goal is to provide actionable insights to drive data-driven decisions.
