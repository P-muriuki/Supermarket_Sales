# Sales Data Analysis Project
## SQL

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project using SQL on a sales dataset. The project covers data cleaning, identifying duplicates, and uncovering key business insights such as top-selling products, city-wise and branch-wise purchase trends, customer demographics, and product performance relative to costs and ratings. The project will be developed further to visualizations using PowerBI, the goal is to provide actionable insights to drive data-driven decisions.

# Visualizations using PowerBI
I created an interactive dashboard and a presentation using Power BI to analyze supermarket sales trends in Myanmar.


Key Insights:
1️⃣ Mandalay shows significant potential for supermarket expansion due to growing consumption trends.
2️⃣ Naypyitaw has lower tourist activity, so supermarkets should focus on household essentials.
3️⃣ Both Mandalay and Naypyitaw experience sales peaks three times a week, with Saturday being a high-sales day in Mandalay.

For detailed explanations, refer to the presentation included in this repository.

Note: The analysis is based on economic trends and assumes political stability similar to Myanmar’s pre-existing structure.
